This is a procedural narative generator made with a few goals:

* To generate an nearly infinite world only bound by your imagination
* To give a player ability to interact with nearly everything in nearly infinite way and change the world in a way never seen before
* Generate unique scenarious, quests and characters
* Just to make something cool :)

Inspired by few talks on GDC about procedural generation and Dwarf Fortress.

This is STILL work in progress and current state of this project is in: PROOF OF CONCEPT
The changelog (if any) will be filled with updates and changes (mostly major)
